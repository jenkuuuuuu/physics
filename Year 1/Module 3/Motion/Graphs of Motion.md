### Displacement-Time Graphs
A displacement-time graph shows how the displacement of a moving object varies with time. Displacement is plotted on the vertical axis, and time is plotted along the horizontal axis.

##### Interpreting displacement-time graphs
`Velocity` can be found using displacement-time graphs; as the gradient of a graph is equal to the instantaneous velocity of a moving object.

A straight, diagonal line represents a constant velocity while a flat, horizontal line represents a stationary object.
A curve indicates that the velocity is not uniform. You can find the instantaneous velocity by drawing a tangent against the curve, and finding its gradient. 

### Velocity-Time Graphs
A velocity-time graph shows how the velocity of a moving object varies with time. Velocity is plotted on the vertical axis, and time is plotted against the horizontal axis.

##### Interpreting velocity-time graphs
`Acceleration` is found using the gradient of the graph, as it uses the change in velocity and the time taken.

A straight, diagonal line represents an acceleration while a flat, horizontal line represents a constant velocity. With a positive gradient, a diagonal line will show acceleration; while, with a negative gradient it will show deceleration.

The area below a graph gives the displacement of the object.
