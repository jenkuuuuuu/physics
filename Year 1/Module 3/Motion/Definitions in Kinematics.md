### Speed and Velocity
Speed and distance are both scalar quantities, while velocity and displacement are vectors as they both have a direction.
$$\begin{align}
& \text{average speed} = \frac{\text{total distance travelled}}{\text{time taken}} \\ \\

& \text{average velocity} = \frac{\text{total displacement}}{\text{time taken}}
\end{align}$$
Average speed and instantaneous speed are different quantities. Average speed is the total distance over the total time taken, while the instantaneous speed is the speed at a single point during the journey.
##### Displacement
Displacement is a vector quantity, showing the direct distance of an object from its starting point, rather than the total distance travelled.
### Acceleration
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, given by
$$\begin{align}
 & \text{acceleration} = \frac{\text{change in velocity}}{\text{time taken}}
\end{align}$$
Acceleration can be both positive and negative, showing an acceleration and a deceleration. For an object moving in the positive direction, a positive acceleration suggests an acceleration and a negative acceleration suggests a deceleration; while an object moving in the negative direction will have a positive acceleration when decelerating.
