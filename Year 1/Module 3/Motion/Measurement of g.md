### Investigating Motion
Velocity and acceleration can be determined using motion sensors, or light gates connected to a data logger. 
A light gate measures the time taken for a card attached to an object to move between two points, while a motion sensor records the displacement of an object at regular intervals, which can then be used to determine velocity and acceleration.

These methods allow for more accuracy, as it eliminates human reaction time, which would otherwise be a factor when using a stopwatch.

#### Determining the acceleration of free fall
There are two main types of approach to measuring acceleration due to gravity:
- Direct approaches, such as timing a falling ball to calculate acceleration using the equations of motion
- Indirect approaches, such as measuring the time taken for a pendulum to complete a full swing
Both cases find the value of $g$ using an equation containing a term for acceleration due to gravity.

#### Methods
##### Trap door & Electromagnet
This experiment consists of a steel ball being supported by an electromagnet. When the current running through the electromagnet is cut off, a timer will start. The ball will then fall onto a trap door, triggering the timer again to stop it. The distance that the ball fell can then be found using a ruler.

This gives the values needed for $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$.
- $u$ is 0, as the ball starts from rest
- $t$ is the measured time from the timer
- $s$ is the distance that the ball has fallen
- $a$ is the value being calculated
Because of this, the equation can be simplified to $g=\frac{2s}{t^2}$

This can be plotted on a graph of distance against time^2^, with a gradient of $\frac{g}{2}$

##### Light gates & Data Logger
This experiment consists of a light gate and data logger measuring the time taken for a card to fall through the light gate. The height from which the card is dropped from will be measured using a ruler, and the average velocity of the card can be found using $v=\frac{L}{t}$, where L is the length of the card and t is the time taken for the card to pass through the light gate. 

From here, you have the values needed for $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$
- $u$ is 0, as the card starts from rest
- $s$ is the height that the card was dropped from
- $v$ is calculated using $v=\frac{L}{t}$
- $a$ is the value being calculated
Because of this, the equation can be simplified to $2g=\frac{v^2}{s}$

This can be plotted on a graph of distance against time^2^, with a gradient of $2g$
