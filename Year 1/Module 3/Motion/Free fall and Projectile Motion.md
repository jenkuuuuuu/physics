Free fall is the acceleration of a body because of acceleration due to gravity, ignoring air resistance. 

Object with different masses will fall at the same rate, as the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to its mass. An object with a greater mass will have a larger inertia (meaning resistance to changes in motion). Because of this, 2 objects of different masses will land at the same time.
##### Objects thrown upwards
An object thrown vertically will always have a constant acceleration of -g; meaning the acceleration is in the opposite direction to the velocity. 
___
### Vertical and Horizontal Motion
When considering the motion of an object moving both horizontally and vertically, you handle the two components separately. The horizontal motion of an object will not affect its vertical motion, and vice versa.

Ignoring air resistance, the horizontal velocity will always be constant, while the vertical movement will accelerate; because of acceleration due to gravity.
