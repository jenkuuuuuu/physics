### Work
Work is a scalar quantity, which can be thought of as the amount of energy transferred from one store to another.
Work done is found using the equation:
$$W = F \times d$$

The S.I. unit of work is the joule (J), which is the equivalent of Nm. One joule of work is transferred when a force of 1N causes an object to move a distance of 1m in the direction of the force.

___
When considering force at an angle to the direction of motion, you need to use the component of the force which acts parallel to the direction of the movement. 

For example, if a force is acting at $36\degree$ to a movement, the component of the force causing a horizontal movement will be $F\times \cos(36\degree)$
