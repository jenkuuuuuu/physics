Energy can be transferred from one form to another, from a number of different stores.

| Form of energy    | Equation used        |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Kinetic           | $E=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$  |
| Gravitational     | $E=mg\Delta h$       |
| Thermal           | $E = mc\Delta T$     |
| Elastic potential | $E = \frac{1}{2} Fe$ |
| Nuclear           | $E=mc^2$             |

In any closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed; only transferred from one store to another. Therefore, the total energy available before any process is equal to the energy after the conversion has happened.

However, transferring energy from one form to another is never 100% efficient. Not all of the energy is transferred usefully, with the rest being wasted.
