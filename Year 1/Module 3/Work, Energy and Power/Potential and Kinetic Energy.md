#### Kinetic Energy
The kinetic energy of an object depends on its mass and velocity. When it accelerates, it will gain kinetic energy.

$\Delta KE$ is found using:
$$\Delta KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
#### Gravitational Potential Energy
Gravitational potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position. The amount of GPE an object has depends on 3 factors:
- its vertical height above the ground, $\Delta h$, measured in metres
- its mass, $m$, measures in kilograms
- the value of $g$

$\Delta GPE$ is found using
$$\Delta GPE = mg\Delta h$$

#### Elastic Potential Energy
When work is done on a wire or spring, it will store elastic potential energy. This energy can then be entirely released when the load is removed, if the object has not been deformed plastically.

$\Delta E$ is found using:
$$E=\frac{1}{2}Fx = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
where $k$ is the force constant.
