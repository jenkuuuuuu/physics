#### Power
Power is the rate at which energy is transferred between stored (doing work), measured in watts (W); which are equivalent to Js^-1^

Power can be found using:
$$\text{power} = \frac{\text{work done}}{\text{time taken}}$$

If a component has a rating of 100W, it will transfer 100J of energy per second.

#### Efficiency
When energy is transferred, not 100% will be transferred to the useful store. For example, most filament lightbulbs have an efficiency of 3%; with 3% of the input energy being transferred to light energy, and the other 97% being wasted - typically as thermal energy.

The efficiency of a component is typically represented using a Sankey diagram; with the input energy being shown with multiple arrows representing the different energy stores that are output.
