A force is generally regarded as a push or pull acting on one or more bodies. 
___
#### The four fundamental forces of nature
- The Gravitational Force
	Every particle of matter in Universe experiences gravity. The force is directly proportional to the product of the masses of both bodies, and inversely proportional to the square of their separation. As the distance between their centres of mass increases, the force they exert on eachother decreases significantly.
- The Electromagnetic Force
	The electromagnetic/electrostatic force holds atoms and molecules together. It can be attractive, or repulsive, and has an infinite range.
- The Weak Interaction
	This is responsible for radioactive decay, and is weak in nature. It acts over a small range, around 10^-18^m.
- The Strong Interaction
	This is responsible for holding subatomic particles in the nucleus of atoms, and is the strongest of the 4 forces. It acts over a small range, around 10^-15^m.
