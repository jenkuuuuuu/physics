Dynamics is concerning the motion of bodies, and the forces that cause that motion to happen. Kinematics is similar, however kinematics only studies the motion of bodies without any reference to the forces.
#### Tension
Tensions is experienced by any rope, string, cable, or wire that is being pulled, hung, rotated, or supported.
Tension can cause objects to accelerate or change their shape.

Tension can be found using the equation
$$F=T-mg$$
##### Normal Contact Force
The normal contact force, or the reaction force, is the force acting perpendicular to the point of contact between a body, and a surface it is in contact with.
##### Upthrust
Upthrust is the upward force that a body experiences when floating in any fluid, due the the weight of the fluid displaced.
A body falling through any fluid will experience both drag and upthrust.
##### Friction
Friction is a force occurring between two surfaces in contact with one-another. Friction opposes motion at the point of contact.

### Free-Body Diagrams
A free-body diagram is a labelled drawing, used to show the forces acting on a body.
It features:
- The body on which the forces act
- The direction of each force
- The type of each force
- The size of each force
If multiple forces are acting on an object, you can analyse the acceleration through resolving the forces on the diagram along the same two directions.
