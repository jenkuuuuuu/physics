A fluid is either a liquid or a gas. When any body moves through a fluid, it experiences drag.

#### Friction and Air Resistance
Any objects that are in contact with eachother experience a frictional force. 
Drag is an example of a frictional force, experienced by any object moving through a fluid. For example, air resistance and water resistance.

#### Terminal Velocity
When an object falls, it initially accelerates because the downwards gravitational force is greater than the opposing forces. 
As the body accelerates, it will experience a greater drag. At some point, the resistive forces become equal to the acceleration of the falling object. At this point, the velocity of the object will be constant. This is the objects terminal velocity.
