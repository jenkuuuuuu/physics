Pressure is `force per unit area`, measured in pascals (*Pa*), determining the effect of a force on a surface. 

By spreading a force over a larger area, the pressure is reduced and the effect of the force is lessened as the same force isn't as "concentrated" on a single point. The opposite also applies; as by spreading a force over a smaller area the pressure is increased and the effect will be greater.

### Calculating Pressure in Fluids
Liquids and gases are both fluids, and so they both experience a pressure caused by the fluid itself and the atmospheric pressure. 

The pressure in fluids causes a force that is normal (meaning at $90\degree$) to its surface. 
The equation to calculate the pressure on a fluid is such: 

$$
pressure = \frac{\text{force normal to a surface}}{\text{area of the surface}}
$$

Pressure ($P$) is measured in pascals ($Pa$)
Force ($F$) is measured in newtons ($N$)
Area ($A$) is measured in metres squared ($m^2$)

### Calculating Pressure caused by a Liquid

The pressure caused by a column of liquid is calculated using the equation:
$$
pressure = \text{height of column } \times \text{ density of the liquid } \times \text{ gravity }
$$

Pressure ($P$) is measured in pascals ($Pa$)
Height ($h$) is measured in metres ($m$)
[[Density]] ($\rho$) is measured in kilograms per metre cubed ($\text{kgm}^{-2}$)
Gravitational Field Strength ($g$) is measured in newtons per kilogram ($Nkg^{-1}$) [^1]
