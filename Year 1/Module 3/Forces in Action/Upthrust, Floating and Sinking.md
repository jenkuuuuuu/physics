An object submerged in a fluid will experience greater pressure on its bottom surface than its top surface. This causes an upwards resultant force, called `upthrust`. Upthrust is equal to the weight of the fluid being displaced by the object.

If the upthrust is less than the weight of the object, it will sink. 
If the density of the object is greater than the density of the fluid, it won't be able to displace enough fluid creating an upthrust equal to or greater than its weight.

If the upthrust is greater than the weight of the object, it will float.
If the density of the object is less than the density of the fluid, it will be able to displace enough fluid to create an upthrust greater than its weight.

This is why when you place liquids of different densities on top of eachother, they will seperate into layers.
