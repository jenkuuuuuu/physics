### Moments
When a force acts on an object, it can cause the object to accelerate. 
A force acting through the object's [[centre of mass]], parallel to the ground, can cause the object to move in a straight line; increasing it's velocity.

Alternatively, a force can be applied to an object causing it to rotate. This force is often perpendicular to the axis of rotation, leading to a *turning moment* being set up.

$$\begin{align}
 & \text{turning moment (N m)} = \text{magnitude of force (M)} \times \text{distance of force from a fixed point(m)}
\end{align}$$
The `principle of moments` states that for an object to be in rotational [[equilibrium]], the sum of the clockwise moments must equal the sum of the anticlockwise moments.

### Couples
A couple occurs when two equal, antiparallel forces act to produce a rotation.
The two forces are parallel to eachother but act in opposite directions. For example, they may be both clockwise or both anticlockwise.

The turning moment (torque) due to a couple is the product of one of the forces, and the separation between them.
