If the resultant force acting on an object is zero, then the object is said to be in equillibrium.

A zero resultant force means zero acceleration for the object. It will continue moving at a constant speed, or remain stationary. 

The resultant force of two forces acting on a body can be found in two main ways:
- By scale drawing
- By calculation from a right-angled vector triangle
