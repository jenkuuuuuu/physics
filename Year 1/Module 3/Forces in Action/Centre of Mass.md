The whole mass of an object can be thought of as acting at a single point; called its centre of mass.
If a force acts on an object directly through its centre of mass, it will move in a straight line; otherwise it will move with an added rotational motion.

The centre of gravity of an object is the single point through which the entire weight of an object can be thought to act. Weight can be shown as a vertical down arrow pointing through the centre of gravity.

___
##### Finding the Centre of Mass or Centre of Gravity of an Object
1) Make three holes in random places on the edge of the shape
2) Hang the shape from the first hole using a pin. Let the shame come to rest.
3) Use a plumb line to draw a vertical line from the point of suspension to the bottom of the shape
4) Repeat this for each point
The point at which all lines overlap will be the objects centre of mass.
