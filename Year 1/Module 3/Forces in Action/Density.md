Density is a quantity that is constant for a specific material, regardless of it's mass or volume. 

Density can be found using:
$$\begin{align}
 & \rho = \frac{m}{V}
\end{align}$$
Where $\rho$ is density, $m$ is the mass and $V$ is volume.

The volume of regular objects can be found using calculations.

| Cube    | Rectangular Prism     | Sphere                 | Cylinder     | Cone                    |
| ------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| $V=l^3$ | $v=l\times b\times h$ | $V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ | $V=\pi r^2h$ | $V=\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h$ |

The volume of irregular shapes can be found using a displacement can. Fill the can to the spout with water, and place the object inside. Collect the water which flows over in another beaker. The volume of the water in the beaker will be equal to the volume of the shape. 

You can then use the mass of the object, found using a mass balance, dividing it by its volume to find the density.
