It is difficult to compare the properties of materials, as extension will change dependent on the thickness and length of a spring along with the force applied. Because of this, materials can be compared using stress and strain.

Stress ($\sigma$) is given as
$$\text{stress} = \frac{\text{force}}{\text{cross-sectional area}}$$
and strain ($\epsilon$) is given as
$$\text{strain} = \frac{\text{extension}}{\text{original length}}$$

When stress acts on a material, it causes strain; dependent on the stiffness of the material. A stiff material will not deform much when stress is applied. Materials that are stiff will have a large Young modulus.

The Young modulus of a material, measured in $nm^{-2}$ is given using
$$\text{Young modulus}= \frac{\text{stress}}{\text{strain}}$$
Or through finding the gradient of a stress-strain graph.

The unit for the Young modulus and stress are the same, as strain is dimensionless. This means it has no units.
