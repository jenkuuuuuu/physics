When a force is applied to a solid, causing it to compress or stretch, the spacing of the atoms inside will be changed; meaning the object has been deformed. When the force is removed, the solid may either return to its original shape or maintain its new shape.

Elasticity is the ability for a body to return to its original shape or size once a deforming force has been removed, while plasticity is the opposite; meaning that when an object has undergone *elastic deformation*, it will be able to return to its original shape; while *plastic deformation* means it will remain deformed.

The `elastic limit` of an object is the greatest force it can undergo while still being able to return to its original form. If a body experiences a force beyond its elastic limit, it will remain permanently deformed.

### Hooke's Law
Hooke's law states that the extension of an object is directly proportional to the force acting on it.
$$F=kx$$
Where $F$ is the force causing the extension ($N$), $k$ is the force constant ($Nm^{-1}$) and $x$ is the extension ($m$).

The force constant can be found from a force-extension graph; where it will be the gradient; as $\frac{\Delta F}{\Delta x} = k$.

When stretching a material, work done will be dependent on the magnitude of the stretching force and the distance moved in the direction of the force. As F is not constant during extension, you consider the average force and not a single value.
$$\text{work done} = \frac{1}{2}Fx$$
As $F=kx$, this can be expressed as:
$$\text{work done}= \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
