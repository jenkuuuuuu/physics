Materials can be categorised by their individual properties, each of which making them specialised for different purposes.


| Property        | Description                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength        | The ability to withstand great force or pressure                                                                     |
| Malleability    | The ability to sustain plastic deformation without fracturing when experiencing compressive forces                   |
| Ductility       | The ability for a material to sustain plastic deformation without fracturing, being able to be drwan out into a wire |
| Brittleness     | The ability of a material to fracture with little elastic deformation                                                |
| Stiffness       | The extent to which an object resists deformation                                                                    |
| Hardness        | The ability to resist plastic deformation through scratching                                                         |
| Density         | The ratio of a material's mass to its volume                                                                         |
| Elasticity      | The ability of a body to return to its original shape after being deformed                                           |
| Plasticity      | The inability of a body to return to its original shape after being deformed                                         |
| Toughness       | The ability to absorb energy on impact without fracturing                                                            |
| Conductivity    | The rate at which electricity or heat can act through a material                                                     |
| Fire Resistence | The ability to withstand extreme heat and flame                                                                      |
