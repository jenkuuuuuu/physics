### Determining uncertainty using graphs
To determine the uncertainty on a graph, you can draw lines of maximum and minimum gradient through the appropriate points, and also using error bars to show the uncertainty of specific measurements. 

1) Add error bars to each point, typically the same size for each measurement. 
2) Draw a line of best fit through the points, discarding any major outliers.
3) Calculate the gradient of the line of best fit
4) Draw a line of worst fit, calculating the gradient of it as well.
5) $$
\text{percentage uncertainty} = \frac{\text{uncertainty}}{\text{gradient of best fit line}}\times 100\%   
   $$
where uncertainty is 
   $$
   \text{gradient of best fit line} - \text{gradient of worst fit line}
   $$


Alternatively, you could draw the maximum and minimum lines, halving the difference between their gradients to find the uncertainty.

#### Determining the uncertainty of a y-intercept on a graph
1) Draw the line of best fit, finding the best fit y-intercept.
2) Draw the lines of minimum and maximum gradient, finding their y-intercepts 
3) Halving the difference between the minimum and maximum y-intercepts to find uncertainty
4) $$
   \text{percentage uncertainty} = \frac{\text{uncertainty}}{\text{best y intercept value}} \times 100\%
   $$
