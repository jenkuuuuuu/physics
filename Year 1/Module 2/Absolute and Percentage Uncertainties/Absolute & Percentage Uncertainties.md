When measuring a value, the outcomes will not be the same every time, which could be due to the equipment being used, the skill of the person using the equipment. Because of this, there is always uncertainty in the results.

### Absolute Uncertainty
When taking **single** readings, the `absolute uncertainty` is usually given as the smallest division on the instrument being used. For example, when using a ruler graduated in cm and mm, the absolute uncertainty will be $\pm0.05mm$

When combining **multiple** readings, you have to produce a _combined_ absolute uncertainty, through adding together the absolute uncertainty of all of the individual readings.  

Some measurements will be impacted by human reaction time too. For example, stopwatches usually have a resolution of $\pm0.1s$, however the average human reaction time is $0.5s$. Because of this, the uncertainty given for the measurement will use the uncertainty of reaction time instead of the instrument; $\pm0.5s$ 

### Percentage Uncertainty
Typically, a percentage uncertainty is included in the evaluation of an experiment. For single readings, the equation is:
$$
\text{percentage uncertainty} = \frac{\text{uncertainty}}{\text{ measured value}} \times 100\%
$$
Here, uncertainty is given by the resolution of the instrument used, and measured value is the reading from the equipment.

When taking multiple readings, [[Errors#Random Error|Random Errors]] will be present. To calculate the percentage uncertainty, there are multiple steps: 
1) Write down the repeat readings in a table,
2) Find, and record, the mean of these readings,
3) Find the range of these readings,
4) Half the range to find the absolute uncertainty,
5) $$
\text{percentage uncertainty} = \frac{\text{uncertainty}}{\text{mean of measured values}}\times 100\%   
   $$
