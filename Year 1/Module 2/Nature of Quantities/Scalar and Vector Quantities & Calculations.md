`Scalar quantities` are quantities that have a magnitude, and no direction; while `vector quantities` have both magnitude and direction.

### Scalar Arithmetic
Scalar quantities that are expressed in the same *unit* can be added and subtracted straightforwardly. Quantities should be normalised to have the same prefix, for example if you have 5600g and want to add it to 4.2kg, you convert it to 5.6kg to get 9.8kg. 

Values that have different units cannot be added or subtracted, as they are different physical quantities.

### Vector Arithmetic
Vectors are typically represented by an arrow, with the direction of the arrow representing the vector's direction and the size of the arrow representing its magnitude. Both magnitude and direction have to be taken into account when performing arithmetic. 

Vectors that act parallel or anti-parallel can just be added or subtracted from eachother.
##### Vector Triangles
Vector triangles can be used to show how multiple vectors can act on an object at the same time, in different directions. The 3rd side of the triangle is used to represent the `resultant vector`, and can be found using Pythagoras' theorem and trigonometry.

For vectors that don't act at 90$\degree$ from eachother, you have to make a scale drawing of the triangle and then measure the size of the resultant using a ruler and protractor.
