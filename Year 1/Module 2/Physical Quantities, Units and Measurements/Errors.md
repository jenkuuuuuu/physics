### Systematic Error
A `systematic error` is an error introduced by an inaccuracy in the equipment being used, or by the person using it, that causes all results to be shifted in the same direction.  
##### Zero error 
A `zero error` is a type of systematic error caused by a piece of equipment not being properly calibrated or adjusted, such that it gives a non-zero value when at true zero.
___
### Random Error
A `random error` is an error caused by unknown and unpredictable changes during an experiment, causing results to differ from what is expected. This can be from environmental factors, such as wind.
##### Human Errors
A `human error` is when someone makes an error when reading or recording a value, causing results to differ from what is expected. Human errors can be seen when a result is repeated, as one of the values will be inconsistent. 
____
### Parallax Error
A `parallax error` is an error caused by the angle at which a measurement is taken. When reading off of equipment, such as a ruler, you should stay at eye level with the subject being measured for an accurate result.
