Accuracy and precision are two closely related terms, often used generally as synonyms, but which are two separate concepts in physics.

### Precision
`Precision` refers to how similar, or close together, results are. The smaller the range of a set of results, the more precise they are.

Precision is also often used alongside `resolution`; the smallest change in a quantity that an instrument can measure. For example, a resolution of $\pm0.01$ means that a change in 0.01 of a unit (for example, time on a stopwatch) is the smallest change that the equipment can measure. Compared to an instrument with a resolution of $\pm0.1$, the repeat readings will have a higher precision.

### Accuracy
`Accuracy` refers to how close recorded results are to the true, or *commonly accepted*, value that you intended to find. 

For example, if you conducted an experiment to find ___acceleration due to gravity___, a value of 9.93ms^-1^ would be more accurate than a value of 9.66ms^-1^, as it is closer to the *commonly accepted* value of 9.81ms^-1^
