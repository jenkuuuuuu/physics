### Constructive Interference
If the peaks and troughs of two waves align, they are said to be `in phase`. 
If two waves with similar frequencies coincide while in phase, their amplitudes are essentially added together, producing a wave with double the amplitude.

### Destructive Interference
If two waves coincide at $180\degree$ out of phase, each peak will align with the opposing trough. This essentially subtracts the amplitudes, resulting in a wave with zero amplitude.
