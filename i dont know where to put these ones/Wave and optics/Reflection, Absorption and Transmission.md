### Reflection
When a wave meets a boundary, such as an opaque surface, it can be reflected. The law of reflection states that the `angle of incidence = angle of reflection`

### Absorption
When a wave meets a boundary, its energy can be transferred to the object it is interacting with. This increases the internal energy of the material, typically causing it to increase in temperature.

### Transmission
When a wave meets a boundary, it can pass through the material, such as when light passes through a transparent material such as glass. If at an angle, this may occur simultaneously with refraction.
