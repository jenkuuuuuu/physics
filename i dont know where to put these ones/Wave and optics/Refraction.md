Refraction is the bending of a wave as it passes through to a different medium, causing it to redirect. This is due to the change in wave speed and the initial angle that the wave meets the new medium (the angle of incidence).

Refraction is typically observed in light waves, however other waves do experience it too.


A normal is a dotted line drawn perpendicular to the surface of the new medium, at the point where the wave enters. 

> When a wave crosses into a denser medium than air, it will refract towards the normal.
> When a wave crosses from that denser medium to air, it will refract away from the normal.

The change in direction of the wave depends on the change in speed and can be used to calculate the refractive index.

Say the angle of incidence is $\theta^1$ while the angle of refraction is $\theta^2$. 
You can use the calculation

$$
n = \frac{{\sin \theta^1}}{\sin\theta^2}
$$

The refractive index depends om the frequency of the wave. Waves of a higher frequency have a greater refractive index than those at a lower frequency. This explains why white light can be dispersed into different colours by a prism.
