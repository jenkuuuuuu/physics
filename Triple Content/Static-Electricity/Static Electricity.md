`Static Electricity` is a non-contact force allowing charged objects to affect other charged objects.

When insulating materials are rubbed against eachother, they may become electrically charged, as friction causes the electrons to gain enough energy to leave the atom of one material, and rub off onto the other. This causes the material losing electrons to become postively charged, and the material gaining electrons to become negatively charged. 

This only affects insulating materials, and not conductors, as the electrons cannot move and so the charge remains static (hence static electricity), while conductors cannot become charged as the electrons can flow through them.

A charged object will experience a non-contact force from another charged object, depending on whether it is positively or negatively charged. Opposites attract, while like charges repel.
The forces of attraction and repulsion will become weaker at a greater distance, and stronger when the two objects are closer.
