An electric field is a region around a charged object where other charged particles will experience a force.

Electrical fields are usually depicted with field lines, pointing away from positive charges and towards negative charges. 

In a radial field around a positively charged particle, the lines will be drawn as going outwards and away. Other positively charged particles will be repelled, while a negatively charged particle will attract; acting in the opposite direction of the field lines.

A positively charged and negatively charged plate placed in parallel will create a uniform field. The field lines are straight, pointing from the positive plate towards the negative plate.
