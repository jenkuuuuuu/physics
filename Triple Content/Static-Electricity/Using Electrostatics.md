Static electricity can be used in many industrial applications to make use of the forces of attraction and repulsion.

- ### Insecticide
Insecticide sprays from aircrafts can be charged to cover a large area. The drops are static and so spread evenly over a wide area, as they all have the same charge and repel eachother. This reduces the risk of uneven coverage.
- ### Photocopiers
Photocopiers make use of static electricity to attract ink into the correct places onto paper.
- ### Electrostatic precipitator
Static electricity can be used to clean small particles from smoke before it leaves an industrial chimney, through attracting them.

## Dangers of Electrostatics
All charged objects can be *discharged* through being *earthed*. This can be done safely through connecting them to the earth with a conductor.

If a charge is large, a spark to the earth may happen unexpectedly, potentially igniting a fire. This is typically due to the build-up of static charge over time, such as from fuel running through pipes. Because of this, aircrafts are earthed through a conductor during refuelling.

A spark discharge may occur when a charged person touches an earthed conductor, such as touching a door handle or other person after being charged. This leads to a small spark, and a slight shock.
