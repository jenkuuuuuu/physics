Gravity allows bodies to maintain a stable orbit around other celestial bodies, such as planets around a star and moons around a planet.

For an object to stay in orbit, it must remain at a speed where the gravitational attraction between the planet and the satellite cannot be too strong, or too weak such that it either leaves orbit and moves into space or fall towards the planet. 

For example, for a satellite to remain in Earth's orbit it must be at a speed between *7600ms^-1^* and *11200ms^-1^*.

### Orbits and Constant Speed
When an object moves in a circle at a constant speed, it's direction will *constantly* be changing, causing a change in velocity. A change in velocity results in acceleration, so an object moving in a circle is accelerating.

An object only accelerates if a resultant force acts on it. For an object moving in a circle, the resultant force is the `centripetal force`, which acts towards the centre of the circle. Gravitational attraction provides the centripetal force which keeps objects in orbit.

### Orbits and Changing Speed
The strength of gravitational attraction decreases with distance. Because of this, the acceleration of planets further from the sun will be lesser than that of ones that are closer. 
With less of a change in velocity, the object will move slower, and so planets with a larger orbit (further from the sun) will move slower than those with a smaller orbit. 

##### Artificial Satellites
Artificial satellites follow one of two orbits:
- Polar Orbits
- Geostationary Orbits

`Polar orbits` take the satellite directly over the poles of the Earth, at close proximity to it (as low as 200km above sea level). Because of this, they have to move at high speeds.

`Geostationary orbits` take 24 hours to orbit the Earth, and so appear stationary in the sky. They are at a far greater distance than polar orbits, typically `36000km`, and so move at a slower speed too - often around *3kms^-1^*.
