### Planets

There are 8 planets in the Solar System, at different distances from the sun.
- Mercury
- Venus
- Earth
- Mars
- Jupiter
- Saturn
- Uranus
- Neptune

As you get further away from the Sun, the surface temperature of each planet drops, and [[Orbital Motion#Orbits and Changing Speed|the time taken to orbit the Sun increases|]]. For example, Mercury is $480\degree c$ and takes 88 days to complete it's orbit, while Neptune is $-200\degree c$ and a single orbit takes 165 years.
#### Moons
Moons are natural satellites that orbit a planet. Some planets may have many; such as Jupiter with over 50, while Earth only has 1.
#### Dwarf Planets
A Dwarf Planet is a celestial body, similar to a planet, in direct orbit around the Sun but without a gravitational field strong enough to "clear the neighbourhood" (meaning there are no other bodies of a similar size in its orbital zone and as such it is gravitationally dominant.)
#### Asteroids
Asteroids are smaller bodies orbiting the Sun; mainly composed of metals and other materials released, during the formation of the Sun, that didn't become planets. Asteroids are mainly found in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, in the region beyond Neptune called the Kuiper Belt or following the orbits of planets.
#### Comets
Comets are small, icy celestial bodies mainly composed of rock, dust and ice, typically with trapped gas inside. As they approach the Sun, they vaporise and release those gases in a process called outgassing. This causes them to produce a distinctive trail.
