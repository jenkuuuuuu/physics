The current model of the Solar System has all planets at different distances orbiting the Sun, however this wasn't always the case. 

Due to historical models having to be made by eye, they often lacked detail. This is due to most far planets not being visible to the naked eye, along with asteroids, and natural satellites. 

One of the earliest models of the Solar System is credited to Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy (AD 100-168), which featured Earth at the centre - as would other models. This led to complex descriptions of planets positions.

##### Putting the Sun at the Centre
Changing the model to feature the Sun concentrically is generally credited to Nicolas Copernicus (1473-1543), and has since been backed up with observations made using telescopes.

##### Classifying Planets
Celestial bodies have to meet a certain criteria to be classed as a Major, Minor or Dwarf planet. Until 2006, there were 9 planets in our Solar System, with Pluto being reclassified as a Dwarf planet after the International Astronomical Union made changes to it's definition of a planet to "clearing the neighbourhood". Pluto shares it's orbital neighbourhood with bodies in the Kuiper Belt, and as such hasn't cleared the neighbourhood; leaving us with 8 planets.
