The Life Cycle of Stars is greatly dependent on their size. All stars form the same way, when a cloud of dust and gas, known as a nebula, becomes a protostar, which then develops to become a main sequence star.

From there, there are 2 paths based on their mass.
> Stars around or below the mass of our Sun follow this:
> Red Giant Star -> White Dwarf -> Black Dwarf

> Stars far greater than the mass of our Sun follow this:
> Red Super Giant Star -> Supernova -> Black Hole 
> 				or
> Red Super Giant Star -> Supernova -> Neutron Star

##### Nebula
A nebula is a cloud of dust and gas, mainly composed of Hydrogen gas. Gravity causes the dust and gas to coalesce.
##### Protostar
As the mass falls together, it increases in temperature. When it is hot enough for the Hydrogen nuclei to fuse together to create helium, the star is formed. This releases energy, keeping the core of the star hot.
##### Main Sequence Star
This is the stable phase of a stars lifespan. Gravity holds the star together, being opposed by the high pressure created due to the high temperatures. This is the phase our Sun is currently at.
##### Red Giant Star
When all of the hydrogen has been used up, larger nuclei may begin to form causing the star to expand.
##### White Dwarf
After all nuclear reactions are over, gravity may cause the star with little mass to contract, causing it to fade and cool.
##### Supernova
A larger star with more mass will continue to react, getting hotter and eventually exploding, expelling hot gas into space. This will leave either a neutron star or a black hole.

### The Sun
The Sun is currently a main sequence star. It formed around 4.6 billion years ago, and will remain as a main sequence star for around 4-5 billion years before expanding and cooling to become a red giant, after which it will shrink and heat up again to become a white dwarf.
