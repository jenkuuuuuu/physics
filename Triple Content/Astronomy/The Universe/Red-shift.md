Light emitted by a star doesn't contain all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Elements inside the star absorb some of the wavelengths, resulting in areas with dark lines present when the light is analysed. Different elements produce different patterns of dark lines.

When observing light from distant galaxies, the dark lines in the spectrum will show an increase in wavelength and decrease in frequency, which causes them to shift towards the red end of the spectrum. This is due to the expansion of the universe, which "stretches" light as it travels towards us. The faster a galaxy is moving away from ours, the more intense the shift to red will appear.

For example, this is the spectra of light emitted by our Sun, and light from another galaxy.
