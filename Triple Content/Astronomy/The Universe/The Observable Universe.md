At first, the only information available about the universe was what could be seen to the human eye. Modern inventions and improvements in technology have allowed us to make more detailed observations.

Modern technology can be made sensitive to electromagnetic frequencies outside of the visible light spectrum, allowing observations to be made through radio waves, infrared or X-ray emissions from distant stars or galaxies.

Many of the wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum don't penetrate the Earth's atmosphere, and so there are telescopes placed on satellites above the atmosphere. This also means they aren't affected by weather conditions, or by day and night light levels.

The Hubble Space Telescope has detectors for visible light, along with both infrared and ultraviolet.
