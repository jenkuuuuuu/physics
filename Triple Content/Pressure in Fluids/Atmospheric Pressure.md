The atmosphere is the layer of air around the Earth, becoming less dense as altitude increases.

Air molecules colliding with a surface causes `atmospheric pressure`. At sea level this is around 101 kPa, and only at around 27 kPa at the cruising altitude of a plane. Because of this, planes need to be pressurised, so that the air pressure is enough for people to intake oxygen.

Atmospheric pressure decreases as the height from ground level increases because:
- the number of air molecules decreases
- the weight of the air decreases
- there is less air above applying pressure
